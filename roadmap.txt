DONE

1. Set up Mongo thru Docker, create a DB and be able to access it
    a. Choose doc schema
    b. Populate some dummy data

2. Node service to serve anime data
    a. Randomly rolls for anime and episode

3. Simple ass website that calls the node service and displays data


4. Script to scrape data from wikipedia and populate mongo DB

5. Discord bot! Doesnt look that complex tbh 

PENDING
- Seed script assumes there's no more than 500 animes per year, should take a look to see if that assumption is true and implement a loop to get the next 500.

- Improve script to also fetch wikipedia raw data per anime and pull info like episode count and demographic




Enhancements:
1. Filters for rolling: demographic, timeframe, other stuff?

2. Better website (GL with that lmao)
